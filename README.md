NOTES ON WHAT I LEARNED: I learned a ton of the git commands to ensure that my VS code on my laptop will always 
be in a repository. This will be important for partner projects or simply if something happened to my laptop. I 
also learned that it is possible to get merge conflicts. It is nice to know that the code will never be lost.
